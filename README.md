# Quorra Windows App
### Introduction
Quorra is a standalone Notes & Calendar app. Users can work seemlessly from both elements and integrate them within eachother. For example, if a user creates an event on their calender and wants to create a note to go with it, the note will directly link to the specific event in the calendar and vice versa. Both elements also work seperately, if the user chooses to do so.

Any data, events or files stored on the app, stay on the app, locally. If the user chooses that they no longer need a specific item, they can delete it freely. This app does not rely on the cloud for storage. Future versions of this application, or migrations to mobile apps, may choose to utilise cloud storage functionality for access across devices.

### Pre-requisites
- This application is built on the .NET-10.0 Runtime for Windows 11
- This application is built and compiled using C#, JavaScript, JSON, CSS & HTML
- Files created on this app are stored in the users local file `i.e. C://ProgramFiles/Quorra/Items/`
